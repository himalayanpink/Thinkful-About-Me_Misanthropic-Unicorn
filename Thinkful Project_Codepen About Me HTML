      <h3 class="h3special">Childhood:</h3>
      <p>Joe the Misanthropic Unicorn was born sometime during the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396.  Little is known of his wanderings in the Ottoman Empire until his fateful meeting with the famed archeologist Heinrich Schliemann in January of 1873.</p>

      <h3>The Incident:</h3>
      <p>The relationship between Joe and Heinrich's wife Sophia was always a troubled one.  After the discovery of the so-called “Jewels of Helen” the Troy dig site at Hissarlik, Joe and Sophia fought over who would be the one to model the find for the now famous photograph.</p>
      <div class= "paragraphspacing"></div>
      <p>Sophia won out as Joe didn't ultimately have the patience to sit still long enough for the long exposure process of the day.</p>
